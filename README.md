Here’s a **professional GitHub README** template for an **Object Detection using OpenCV** project, structured for clarity, technical appeal, and easy deployment:

---

```markdown
# 🎯 Object Detection using OpenCV

A Computer Vision project that performs real-time Object Detection using OpenCV and pre-trained Deep Learning models. The system identifies and highlights objects within images or video streams with bounding boxes and labels.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV (cv2)**
- **Pre-trained Models:**
  - MobileNet-SSD
  - YOLOv3 / YOLOv4 (Optional)
  - Caffe-based DNN models
- **Numpy**

## 🚀 Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-opencv.git
cd object-detection-opencv
````

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🎯 How to Run

### Detect Objects in an Image

```bash
python object_detection.py --image images/sample.jpg
```

### Detect Objects in a Video File

```bash
python object_detection.py --video videos/sample.mp4
```

### Real-time Detection with Webcam

```bash
python object_detection.py --webcam 1
```

*Ensure pre-trained models are available in the `/models` directory.*

---

## ⚡ Example Output

* Draws bounding boxes around detected objects
* Displays object class names with confidence scores
* Supports multiple object categories (person, car, dog, etc.)

---

## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* OpenCV
* Numpy

Install via:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

---

## 🔥 Features

✅ Real-time object detection with webcam
✅ Image and video file detection
✅ Supports various pre-trained models
✅ Adjustable confidence thresholds

---

## 📈 Future Improvements
